## 2026-10-02: parent pathway (0.30.0, uncommitted)

Open items:
- **Consent text v1 awaits user approval** (`consentText()` in `coach/components/familyPage.js`; version `guardian-consent-2026-10-01` in `app_settings`).
- **Publication wording - user decision.** Consent v1 says videos "are never published publicly without my separate written permission", which covers coach uploads of the child too. The demo exporter only refuses *guardian* uploads without publication permission; coach uploads of a linked child are not gated. Either gate coach uploads of any child with a linked parent, or narrow the consent wording, before release.
- **Re-consent is not built - required before any consent version bump after release.** `is_guardian_for_player()` and `family.html` must compare `player_guardians.consent_version` with `current_guardian_consent_version()` and prompt re-acceptance; today a linked parent keeps access under the version they accepted. Fine while there are no real guardians and v1 is unapproved.
- **Known limitation: most coach deletes bypass `delete-clip`.** Only "Delete Pitch" in the player page's game log goes through it. The game-log entry (at-bat) delete in `player.html`, the rep delete in `practicePage.js`, the player delete, and a direct `video_clips` delete under RLS all remove rows only: raw videos stay in GCS (orphaned), no `clip_deletions` audit row, worker frames stay, and the demo-fixture refusal is skipped. `src/cli/reconcileUploads.ts` finds orphaned objects (manual run). Rerouting them is a separate refactor.
- **Phase B (self-coached parents) not started;** the gating decision is open.
- **PRE-DEPLOY checklist** (nothing is deployed):
  - Apply migrations 00041-00045 to hosted (public + demo where they apply) before shipping this coach build (the Review queue selects `uploaded_by_role`; Manage player calls `revoke_guardian_invites`).
  - Before 00043: run the unrecognized-demo-fixture predicate (the `where not (...)` of `unrecognized_demo_fixture_count()` in 00043) against hosted `demo.demo_real_fixtures`. Any row it counts blocks every clip delete until reviewed.
  - Add the app `index.html` URL to hosted Auth allowed redirect URLs (parent sign-up email confirmation returns there).
  - `deno check` every changed Edge Function (`get-family-report`, `delete-clip`, `get-upload-url`, `get-video-url`, `get-player-report`, `_shared/`) and do a deploy dry-run: `_shared/familyReport.ts` imports `../get-player-report/shape.ts` across function directories, and bundling of that is unverified (Deno isn't installed locally).
  - Confirm the Edge Functions' service account has `storage.objects.delete` (delete-clip) and `storage.objects.get` (get-upload-url's existence check).
  - Real GCS: guardian upload URLs are signed with `x-goog-if-generation-match: 0` and the browser sends that header, so the bucket's CORS config must allow it as a request header (`responseHeader`). Unverified against real GCS; the emulator path (`ifGenerationMatch=0`) is tested.
  - The upload worker must run 0.30.0: it purges deleted clips' local files and finishes deletions stuck for over 15 minutes.
- **Tests:** `npm run test:guardians` (`node --import tsx --test supabase/tests/guardians.test.ts`) needs the local stack, `npx supabase functions serve --env-file .env` and the GCS emulator; it is not part of `npm test`.
- **Deferred minors:**
  - `guardian_register_clip` doesn't pin the bucket in `p_raw_gcs_path` (any `gs://<bucket>/` prefix passes; low impact).
  - `delete-clip` classifies errors by message substring, not SQLSTATE.
  - Unlink's 409 "try again" copy loops on a permanent hold (e.g. a clip in a published demo).
  - Invite expiry shown to the coach is computed client-side (mirrors the 7-day default).
  - `listRow` ignores `ariaLabel` (the queue's ", from family" label is dead).
  - Family upload defaults to "Game".
  - Family page "Latest progress check" shows an ISO date.
  - No cap/rate limit on outstanding invites.

## 2026-10-01: demo data + UX pass (0.27.0-0.29.0, uncommitted)

Open items:
- **Coach review of the new AI drafts (blocks a real Priority in the demo).** Local re-analysis of 8 Emily clips (Claude Opus, batter-zoomed stills + swing sequences) produced 33 checkpoint drafts and 0 findings. Drafts for checkpoints already coach-reviewed are not written to `checklist_scores`; they are in `frames/emily/*/phase_stills/analysis_result_*.json` and the local packet `frames/coach-review-2026-10-01/index.html` (unmasked minor - never publish). Notable: hand path Developing on 3/5 swings, bat path 2/4, head/eyes 2/5, load 3/4. Only the coach can turn these into a Priority/Drill.
- **Game1 clips that failed honestly:** `emily_c_ab1_3` (contact not locatable), `emily_c_g2_ab2` (bat never detected, camera too far down the baseline). Marked `failed` locally.
- **Phase detection on 30fps side-on Game1 clips** fires contact early (the swing is often in the "extension" frame). The swing-sequence window now runs to the last located phase as a workaround; the detector itself is unchanged.
- **Review markers are misaligned for Stage-0-trimmed uploads in the coach app** (offset 0 in `devUi.js` `videoTimeFor`); the AI-still side is fixed by `analysisWindow.ts`, the UI side needs the window start stored per clip (schema change).
- **Demo export drops `swing_phases.detail`** (`scrubDerivedEvidence`), so "Zoom on player" won't appear on the public demo until the exporter passes `subject_box` through (needs a privacy decision: it is position-only geometry).
- **Live-site console errors** (Google Fonts, Cloudflare beacon) should be gone with the 0.29.0 service-worker change; unverified until deployed.
- Pre-existing: `checklistReview.js` and `playerDevelopmentSummary.js` are not in `sw.js` ASSETS (offline shell); `package-lock.json`/`mobile/package-lock.json` versions still say 0.18.2.
